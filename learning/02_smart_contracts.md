# 📘 Smart Contracts — GuardianX Learning Notes

## 🤖 What is a Smart Contract?

A **smart contract** is a program stored on a blockchain that runs automatically when triggered.  
It's like a vending machine: put in the right input (SOS alert), and the contract performs a pre-coded action.

### 🔍 Key Features:
- **Autonomous**: Runs without human intervention
- **Immutable**: Once deployed, cannot be changed
- **Transparent**: Anyone can read and verify the code
