# 📘 Blockchain Basics — GuardianX Learning Notes

## 🔗 What Is a Blockchain?

A blockchain is a **decentralized digital ledger** that records data in blocks linked together chronologically. Once data is added, it **cannot be changed**, making it **tamper-proof and transparent**.

### 🔍 Key Features:
- **Immutable**: Data can't be edited or deleted once on-chain
- **Decentralized**: No single entity controls the network
- **Transparent**: Anyone can verify transactions
