# 🧱 LVL 1: GitHub and Project Structure

---

## 🔧 What is GitHub?

GitHub is like **Google Drive for developers**, but smarter.

- Saves every version of your code
- Lets you go back in time
- Allows team collaboration
- Free for public projects

We use it to store:
- Code (`frontend`)
- Learning notes (`learning`)
- Project files (`README.md`, `.gitignore`, etc.)

## 📁 Project Folder Structure

When we set up `guardianx`, we created this:

```plaintext
guardianx/
├── frontend/          → Website UI (React + Vite app)
├── learning/          → Your personal notes + concepts
├── .gitignore         → Tells GitHub what not to upload
└── README.md          → Project introduction file
