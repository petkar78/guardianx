# ðŸ§© Frontend Level 2 â€” React Components & JSX

In this level, you'll learn what **components** are, how **JSX** works, and write your **first React code block** for GuardianX.

## ðŸ§± What is a React Component?

A component is like a **LEGO block** for your app.
Each button, form, or screen is built using small, reusable components.

### Example:
```jsx
function SOSButton() {
  return (
    <button>
      ðŸš¨ Send SOS
    </button>
  );
}
