# 🌐 Frontend Level 1 — Basics for GuardianX

Welcome to the frontend learning journey of GuardianX! This file explains what frontend is, why we're using React, and what happens when your user presses a button like "Send SOS."

## 🧠 What is a Frontend?

The frontend is the **part of your app users interact with** — like buttons, text, forms, and notifications. It’s what people *see and touch* on screen.

Think of GuardianX:
- The "🔐 Connect Wallet" button → frontend
- The "🚨 Send SOS" button → frontend
- The display that says "✅ SOS Sent!" → frontend

## 🧱 What is React?

React is a JavaScript library for building fast, modern frontends. It lets us:
- Create reusable UI blocks (called *components*)
- Handle user actions (clicks, typing, etc.)
- Talk to smart contracts using tools like `ethers.js`

We use **Vite + React** because it’s lightweight and works well on low-spec laptops.
